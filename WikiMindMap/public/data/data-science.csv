Data Science,#data-science,,Data Science,,"Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. For me is when you have a model or hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data. Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.",,,,

Data Science.What is Data Science.Big Data,#big-data,,Big Data,,"Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value. The V's of Big Data: velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value.",,,,
Data Science.What is Data Science.Big Data.Hadoop,#hadoop,,Hadoop,,Took the data and sliced it into pieces and distributed each and replicated each piece or triplicated each piece and they would send it the pieces of these files to thousands of computers first it was hundreds but then now it's thousands now it's tens of thousands. And then they would send the same program to all these computers in the cluster. And each computer would run the program on its little piece of the file and send the results back. The results would then be sorted and those results would then be redistributed back to another process. The first process is called a map or a mapper process and the second one was called a reduce process. So the one thing that's nice about these big data clusters is they scale linearly. You had twice as many servers and you get twice the performance and you can handle twice the amount of data.,,,,

It has a large, standard library that provides tools suited to many different tasks, including but not limited to databases, automation, web scraping, text processing, image processing, machine learning, and data analytics. <br>3. For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. <br>4.

Another way to deploy SparkML models is by using MLeap. Finally, TensorFlow can serve any of its models using the TensorFlow service.

It natively supports Apache Spark ML Pipelines and scikit-learn. A generic, multi-purpose tool called Prometheus is also widely used for machine learning model monitoring, although it’s not specifically made for this purpose. Model performance is not exclusively measured through accuracy. Model bias against protected groups like gender or race is also important. The IBM AI Fairness 360 open source toolkit does exactly this. It detects and mitigates against bias in machine learning models. Machine learning models, especially neural-network-based deep learning models, can be subject to adversarial attacks, where an attacker tries to fool the model with manipulated data or by manipulating the model itself. The IBM Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox can be used to detect vulnerability to adversarial attacks and help make the model more robust. Machine learning modes are often considered to be a black box that applies some mysterious “magic.” The IBM AI Explainability 360 Toolkit makes the machine learning process more understandable by finding similar examples within a dataset that can be presented to a user for manual comparison. The IBM AI Explainability 360 Toolkit can also illustrate training for a simpler machine learning model by explaining how different input variables affect the final decision of the model. <img src=assets/images/DataScience.ToolsforDataScience.DataScienceTools.ModelMonitoringAndAssessment.jpg /> ",,,,

That’s where cluster execution environments come in. The well known cluster-computing framework Apache Spark is among the most active Apache projects and is used across all industries, including in many Fortune 500 companies. The key property of Apache Spark is linear scalability. This means, if you double the number of servers in a cluster, you’ll also roughly double its performance. After Apache Spark began to gain market share, Apache Flink was created. The key difference between Apache Spark and Apache Flink is that Apache Spark is a batch data processing engine, capable of processing huge amounts of data file by file. Apache Flink, on the other hand, is a stream processing image, with its main focus on processing real-time data streams. Although engine supports both data processing paradigms, Apache Spark is usually the choice in most use cases. One of the latest developments in the data science execution environments is called “Ray,” which has a clear focus on large-scale deep learning model training. <img src=assets/images/DataScience.ToolsforDataScience.DataScienceTools.ExecutionEnvironments.jpg /> ",,,,

Each row in the following table represents an increasing value of alpha. <br>The column corresponds to the different polynomial coefficients, and the rows correspond to the different values of alpha. As alpha increases the parameters get smaller. This is most evident for the higher order polynomial features. But Alpha must be selected carefully.

For Alpha equal to 0.01, the estimated function tracks the actual function. When alpha equals one, we see the first signs of underfitting. The estimated function does not have enough flexibility.

First, we check to see whether it's a core data point.<br> A data point is a core point if within neighborhood of the point there are at least M points. <br>For example, as there are six points in the two centimeter neighbor of the red point, we mark this point as a core point. <br>A data point is a border point if A; its neighbourhood contains less than M data points or B; it is reachable from some core point. <br>Here, reachability means it is within our distance from a core point. It means that even though the yellow point is within the two centimeter neighborhood of the red point, it is not by itself a core point because it does not have at least six points in its neighborhood. <br>The grey point is not a core point nor is it a border point. So, we'd label it as an outlier. An outlier is a point that is not a core point and also is not close enough to be reachable from a core point. We continue and visit all the points in the dataset and label them as either core, border, or outlier. <br>The next step is to connect core points that are neighbors and put them in the same cluster. So, a cluster is formed as at least one core point plus all reachable core points plus all their borders.
